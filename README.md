VR_Koulutus_2022 is a educational game made as a part of a thesis according to the wishes of the client company Elomatic Oy.

The game is made in Unity Engine using C#-language. The game has two main objectives: To give player (in this case student) an educative experience in virtual reality through learning by doing 
and to test how a complex virtual machinery can be handled in a VR-device that has a very limited technical capacity.

The game is developed for Oculus Quest 2 -virtual reality glasses.
